# String Cleaner
A post-execution utility designed to wipe sensitive traces from memory.

Targeted Scanning: Specifically scans the javaw.exe process.

Deep Memory Search: Locates all instances of user-defined strings within the RAM.

Secure Overwrite: Overwrites found strings with null bytes (0x00) to prevent detection or memory dumping.

Trace Cleanup: Automatically removes the Oracle JRE usage logs from the system.
